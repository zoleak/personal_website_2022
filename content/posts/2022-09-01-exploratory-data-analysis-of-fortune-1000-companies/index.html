<p>My girlfriend recently just got a new job at a Fortune 1000 company and it led me to ask many different questions. What percent of woman are CEOs? Which states have the most fortune 1000 companies? What are the top profitable companies? The list went on and on.. So I quickly went to google and tried to find a dataset that will allow me to answer some of these questions using python.</p>
<p>I stumbled across a great <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winston56/fortune-500-data-2021" target="_blank">dataset</a> that had exactly what I was looking for. The author of this dataset pulled the data by scraping the <a href="https://fortune.com/" target="_blank">fortune website</a>. He goes into great detail on how he accomplished this in this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/winston56/fortune-500-data-collection/notebook" target="_blank">blog post</a>. I highly recommend checking it out if you are interested in learning more. The data is for the year 2021.</p>
<p>Before I go into explaining how to pull the data into python and the code behind the analysis, I want to touch on what exploratory data analysis even means! Exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short, is a very useful process that data scientists/data analysts use to analyze and investigate data sets. It allows you to gain insights into the main characteristics of your data. Most times this is accomplished by employing different data visulization methods.</p>

<h4>Read in data and perform EDA</h4>
<p>The <code>pandas</code> package can be used to read in cvs files. After the data is read into python, it’s always best to view the structure of your data and view the first few rows.</p>

<p>My first question to answer is how many woman are CEOs. I was quickly able to see this by making a pie chart. As you can see from the chart, there are only 6.8% woman CEOs.</p>

<p>Next, lets see which states have the most companies. I will use a treemap to show this. Although this probably isn’t the best chart to show this I thought it seemed pretty cool. California came out on top with 121.</p>
