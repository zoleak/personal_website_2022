#Introduction to Exploring Fortune 1000 Companies Data using Python

My girlfriend recently got a new job at a Fortune 1000 company, which led me to ask various questions. I wanted to know the percentage of women who are CEOs, which states have the most Fortune 1000 companies, and the top profitable companies. To answer these questions, I searched for a suitable dataset on Google and found one [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winston56/fortune-500-data-2021){target="_blank"} that had exactly what I was looking for. The author of this dataset scraped data from the [fortune website](https://fortune.com/){target="_blank"}. He goes into great detail on how he accomplished this in this [blog post](https://www.kaggle.com/code/winston56/fortune-500-data-collection/notebook){target="_blank"}. I highly recommend checking it out if you are interested in learning more. The dataset contains data for the year 2021.

Before explaining how to extract the data using Python and the code for analysis, I'd like to touch on the meaning of exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is a valuable process used by data scientists and analysts to investigate and analyze datasets. It helps to identify the main characteristics of the data through various visualization techniques.

```{r setup, include=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}

library(reticulate)
py_install("pandas")
py_install("seaborn")
py_install("squarify")
py_install("matplotlib")


```


#### Import modules used for analysis
```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import squarify # makes tree map
import seaborn as sns

```


#### Read in data and perform EDA

 The ```pandas``` package can be used to read in csv files. After the data is read into python, it's always best to view the structure of your data and view the first few rows.

```{python, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
df = pd.read_csv("Fortune_1000.csv") # Read csv file into python

df.dtypes # see structure of data
df.head(n=10)
```


My first question to answer is how many woman are CEOs. I was quickly able to see this by making a pie chart. As you can see from the chart, there are only 6.8% woman CEOs. 

```{python, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
# Find out percent of woman CEOs
wf= df['ceo_woman'].value_counts(normalize=True).to_frame()
# Make pie chart of woman vs. men ceos
labels = "Male","Female"
colors = ["blue", "purple"]
plt.title("Percentage of Male Vs. Female CEOs")
plt.pie(wf["ceo_woman"],labels = labels, autopct = '%.1f%%',
        wedgeprops = {"edgecolor" : "black",
                      'linewidth': 1,
                      'antialiased': True})
                      
plt.show()
                      
```                      

Next, lets see which states have the most companies. I will use a treemap to show this. Although this probably isn't the best chart to show this I thought it seemed pretty cool. California came out on top with 121.

```{python, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}

# Which states have the most fortune 1000 companies
state_count = df['state'].value_counts().rename_axis('state').reset_index(name = 'counts')
# Get top 10 states with the most companies
state_count = state_count.nlargest(20,'counts')
# Make tree map to show states with most fortune 1000 companies
sizes = state_count['counts']
labels =  [f'{state}\n{count}' for state, count in zip(state_count.state, state_count.counts)]
squarify.plot(sizes = sizes, label = labels, pad=True,
              color = 'mediumblue',text_kwargs={'color':'white'})
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Top 10 States with the most headquarters')
plt.show() 
```

Lastly, I want to compare profit vs. revenue in a bar plot. 

```{python, echo=T, warning=F, message=F, results = 'hide'}
# Profit vs. revenue in bar plot
rev_prof = df.nlargest(5,'revenue')
rev_prof = pd.melt(rev_prof,id_vars = ['company'],value_vars = ['revenue','profit'])
sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid")
sns.set_color_codes("pastel")
p1 =sns.barplot(x="value", y="company",hue = "variable",data= rev_prof)
p1.set_title("Profit Vs. Revenue for Top 5 Fortune 1000 Companies")
p1.set(xlabel='Millions ($)', ylabel="")

# Make table to put next to plot to show percent change in rev to prof
df2 = df.nlargest(5,'revenue')
#define custom function
def find_change(df2):
    change = (df2['profit']/df2['revenue'])*100
    return(change)
df3 = df2.groupby('company').apply(find_change).reset_index()
df3=df3.round()
#per_change = rev_prof.groupby('company','variable','value').assign(percent_change = (''))
# Put barplot and table together in same plot

plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.2, bottom=0.4)

the_table = plt.table(cellText=df3.values,
          cellLoc = 'center', rowLoc = 'center',
          transform=plt.gcf().transFigure,
          bbox = ([0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.2]))
the_table.auto_set_font_size(False)
the_table.set_fontsize(6)

plt.show()
```

As you can see, there are numerous different approaches on how to use EDA techniques to gain insights from data. These are just the tip of the iceburg. I recommend checking out [Python Plot Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com){target = "_blank"} to gain a sense of all the different plots you can create. It's a great resource to see whats possible!
