I recently came across an awesome plot created in R using the [rayshader package](https://www.rayshader.com/index.html){target="_blank"} and was completely amazed. The rayshader package allows you to produce 3D data visualizations in R. You can also translate [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} objects into 3D data visualizations. After reading over the package documentation, I gained some motivation to try the package out myself and make a 3D population density map. The 3D map that will be created will be a population density map of the US.

#### Find Dataset

A quick google search of population density of the US brought me to this [census bureau page](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/density-data-text.html){target="_blank"}

#### Read dataset into R and view structure

Now it's time to read the dataset into R and get an understanding of the dataset.

```{r message=FALSE}

library(readxl) # package that allows you to read excel spreadsheets into R

pop_density_df<-read_xlsx("population-density-data-table.xlsx")

str(pop_density_df)
head(pop_density_df,20)

```

#### Clean dataset

Looking over the dataset you can tell that it needs to be cleaned up a bit. For the first map I just want to plot the 2020 population density for the entire US.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
pop_df_2020<-rename(pop_density_df,pop_2020 = ...3,# rename column name ...3 to pop_2020
                    state_name = Area...1)%>%
  select(state_name,pop_2020)%>%
  filter(!pop_2020 =='Population Density 2020 Census')

```

#### Get shapefile with US state boundaries and merge with US Census Data

Now that the data is cleaned up, it's time to get the state boundary shapefile. This can be done by installing and loading the [urbnmapr package](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/urbnmapr/){target="_blank"}. 

```{r message=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr")
library(urbnmapr)
library(tidyverse)

spatial_data_merg <- left_join(pop_df_2020,
                          get_urbn_map(map = "states", sf = TRUE),
                          by = "state_name")

```
