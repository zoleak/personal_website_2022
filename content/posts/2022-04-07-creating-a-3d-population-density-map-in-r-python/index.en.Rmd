I recently came across an awesome plot created in R using the [rayshader package](https://www.rayshader.com/index.html) and was completely amazed. The rayshader package allows you to produce 3D data visualizations in R. You can also translate [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) objects into 3D data visualizations. After reading over the package documentation, I gained some motivation to try the package out myself and make a 3D population density map.

The 3D map that will be created will be of the population density for the US.
