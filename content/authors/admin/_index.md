As an Environmental Specialist with the Bureau of Air Monitoring in New Jersey, I utilize my expertise in data science to research and analyze air quality data using tools such as R, Python, and ArcGIS. I am passionate about solving critical environmental issues and making data-driven decisions.

In my free time, you can find me shredding the gnar at the local skatepark or ski resort. I am always eager to connect with new people and explore new opportunities, so please don't hesitate to reach out
