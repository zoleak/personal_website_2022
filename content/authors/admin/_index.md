As an Environmental Specialist, I work with the Bureau of Air Monitoring to research key issues regarding air quality in New Jersey. As part of our analysis of the vast amounts of data we collect, I use different types of computer software, such as R, Python, ArcGIS, etc.

Solving critical environmental issues and gaining actionable insight from data ignites my passion. Since most of my work involves making data-driven decisions, I have gained extensive experience with data science techniques. I look forward every day to contributing my skills and knowledge to an environment that will make a difference.

When I am not crunching data or creating solutions for a better environment I can be found shredding the gnar at your local skatepark or ski resort. I love meeting people and learning about new opportunities, so please feel free to reach out to me.
