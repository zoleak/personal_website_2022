I'm an Environmental Specialist employed with the NJ Department of Environmental Protection. I work with the Bureau of Air Monitoring, where we research key air quality issues throughout the state. I utilize different computer software such as R, ArcGIS, Python, etc. to analyze the vast amount of data we collect.

Solving key environmental issues and gaining actionable insight from data ignites a fire inside me. Being that a majority of my work involves making data driven decisions, I have gained extensive experience with data science techniques. I look forward everyday to contribute my skills and knowledge in an environment that will make a difference.

When I am not crunching data or creating solutions for a better environment I can be found shredding the gnar at your local skatepark or ski resort. I love meeting new people and learning about new opportunities, so please feel free to reach out to me.
